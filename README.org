 | Status:     | XMPP for power users and digital masochists |
 | Location:   | [[http://github.com/bqv/weechat-xmpp]]          |
 | Version:    | 0.1.1                                       |
 | Disclaimer: | I'm lazy and unashamedly clinically insane  |

* Description

  A weechat plugin in C to extend the chat client to
  support XMPP and a currently minimal but ideally maximal
  set of XEPs.
  My priority here is to have an android-available XMPP client
  that hides as little as possible from the user. To use this with
  android, set up a relay (`/relay`) and see weechat-android.
  I might rewrite this in C++ at some point when I feel like I
  can do it without burning out.

* Usage

  1. Start with =/account add=, use =/help account= for instructions.

  2. Use =/account connect <account-name>= with the name set at
     add-time.

* Installing

  Place xmpp.so in the appropriate place for weechat plugins.

* Dependencies

  - libstrophe (dynamic, dependency)
  - libxml2 (dynamic, dependency)
  - lmdb (dynamic, dependency)
  - libomemo-c (libsignal-protocol-c) (dynamic, dependency)
  - rnp (dynamic, dependency)
  - weechat (>= v3.0)

  .. or just use the guix spec in .envrc

* Building

  #+begin_src sh
  git clone git://github.com/bqv/weechat-xmpp.git
  cd weechat-xmpp
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  make
  make install
  #+end_src

  Do *NOT* run make install as root, it installs the plugin to your
  local weechat plugins directory

* Development

  I use emacs for development of this, although I am also a fan of vim.
  My debug build process involves static analysis with clang and cppcheck,
  and dynamic analysis with address-sanitizer and leak-sanitizer.
  My debug evaluation process involves gdb/mi run with the arguments
  =-ex "handle SIGPIPE nostop noprint pass" --args weechat -a 2>asan.log=
  since part of weechat and it's default plugins use SIGPIPE as control.

  I have no real requests for style of pull requests besides a wish that
  you keep vaguely to the indentation style I use for this project.

  Happy coding!
